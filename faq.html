      <ul class="question">
        <li>
          <h2>1. How should I prepare my house before selling it?</h2>
          <p> First impressions matter in business, but especially in real estate. Anyone walking through a house or
            touring
            it virtually will be looking for ways to pass or negotiate down on the price. You must help clients make
            sure
            that the HVAC, plumbing, and electrical system all work properly. Each room should look clean and
            decluttered
            with no overt damage insight.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>2. Should I order a home inspection?</h2>
          <p> Getting a pre-sale home inspected is never a bad idea, especially to get your client the best price for
            their
            home. Some homebuyers will feel uncomfortable purchasing a house without seeing a home inspection. Many will
            often hire their own inspector. It’s better to be safe than sorry.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>3. How long will it take to sell my home?</h2>
          <p> Once the house is on the market, it may take anywhere from four to six weeks to sell. However, if the
            market
            is
            fairly hot, a seller could see their house off the market within a week. On the flip side, if there is a
            lull
            in
            the market or issues arise such as negotiation, lack of exposure, or house conditions then the property can
            sit
            on the market for months.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>4. What is the selling price of my home?</h2>
          <p> The selling price of a house fluctuates depending on multiple factors. The most common ones are the
            neighborhood
            and what similar-sized houses are currently selling for. Also, look at the age and condition. Do major
            repairs
            need to be done? If so, that might lower the property. And again, the market matters. Like everything else,
            home
            prices vary depending on supply and demand. Your job as a realtor is to best inform your clients about these
            different factors and accurately list their house.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>5. Is there a reason my home’s assessed value differs compared to the market value?</h2>
          <p> A public tax assessor gives the assessed value for a property. This assessment typically occurs yearly
            for
            taxation purposes. The fair market value is an agreed-upon price between a willing buyer and seller. There
            is
            usually a difference between the assessed value and market value. For homeowners, the assessed value is a
            double-edged sword. Because, if their annual assessed value increased then their yearly taxes will also be
            raised. On the flip side, when selling a house it can help boost its market value.</p>
